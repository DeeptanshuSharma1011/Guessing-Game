# Guessing-Game

A simple and fun number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess it.

The game provides hints:

ðŸ“ˆ Too high!

ðŸ“‰ Too low!

ðŸ”¥ You're close! (if within Â±5 of the correct number)

It also tracks the number of attempts in real time, shakes the card on wrong guesses, and celebrates when you win. ðŸŽ‰
